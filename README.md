# Gambit-challenge
I chose option 2 which was to present the data as it is in a mobile friendly way.
I used PHP to read the data and seperate time, serial number and the data itself as. PHP was chosen because I've done something similiar before using it. Frontend is done using Bootstrap and SASS. Data is shown in three ways:

1st one is a visual presentation in small containers laid out in a row.

2nd one is a more simple table view.

3rd one is just raw data file.

index.php = Default page and visual view

listView.php = Table view

reader.php = Reads data.txt and places it into a variable.
